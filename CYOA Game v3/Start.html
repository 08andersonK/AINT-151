        The land of Nerva is an old one. It’s history is filled to the brim with constant conflict with monsters from both inside and out. It's currently ruled over by a high council of nobles and in charge of them are the Council of three; Three Powerful and influential people that have the final say in major actions the realm takes. Due to the constant danger the land has been under, there are parts of its history that have been lost to the realms of history. Due to this, some families and organisations have made it their goal to research these gaps in history and record them.
