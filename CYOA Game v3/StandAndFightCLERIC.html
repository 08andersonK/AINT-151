        Although outnumbered, you decide to stand and fight, it’s just goblins and a couple of wolves after all.
      </p>

      <p> <!-- ONLY if Nakira is in party! -->
        Nakira fights off a wolf using her mace and brute strength, all the while chanting prayers to her deities. Eventually the wolf gets too close and she lands a solid hit on its head, crushing it into the ground in a red mist.

      <p>
        Seeing your fellow adventurers fight bravely, you decide to join them and approach one of the wolfs, sword drawn. Feral and agitated, the wolf jumps at you, teeth glowing in whatever light there is. Remembering your training you step to the side and in one fell swoop, dig your sword into the wolfs head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raising your hands in triumph, you turn to see if anyone saw you… Only to be met with a goblin staring at you, bow drawn and ready to fire. You go to move, reaching for your sword in panic when suddenly you hear a loud thump...
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking down you see a long, crude arrow sticking out of your chest. Slowly reaching for it you fall to your knees. Everything then suddenly goes cold as another arrow plants itself not too far from the first. This time without any pain, almost as if your body couldn't handle it.
      </p>

      <p>
        You fall on your back, looking up at the canopy. Breathing becomes hard, you feel like your out of breath. Slowly the world starts getting darker, was it really night already? Your body goes numb and slowly your eyes get heavy…
      </p>

      <p>
        ...
        <br>
        <br>

        ...
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not yet little one… Your time has not yet come.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly you start of feel warm… almost as if life is flowing into you. After a short amount of time, you are able to slowly open your eyes… and are met with the cleric, who is currently praying.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her voice sounds calm and absolute, clearly she has had to recite this spell countless times. As you come to your senses, you notice the arrows have been removed and the pain is slowly fading. Before long the cleric has finished her prayer and is helping you to your feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gentle lizard woman looks at you with a caring glare and speaks.“You gave us quite a scare there little one… Please try to be more careful in the future, for you never know if I may be able to hold off death”
      </p>

      <p>
        After taking in your surroundings, you find yourself in the middle of what can only be described as a slaughtering ground, with the corpses of goblins and wolves littering the small clearing you now reside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shall we move onwards?” your savior asks, to which you reply with a simple nod.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few more hours, you reach your destination at sundown, but after that fight in the woods, you decide it’s best to rest up and delve into the dungeon tomorrow...
