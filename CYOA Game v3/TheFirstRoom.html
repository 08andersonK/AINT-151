        After making your way down the never ending stairway, you find yourself in what appears to be a room dedicated to a some form of small ritual. In the center is a small stone slab that appears to be used like a table, with various bottles of unknown substances and what appears to be worn out remains of parchments too worn to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something that catches your eye is a small glimmering object in the center of the tabel. Upon closer inspection it appears to be a ring. Golden with a red ruby like gem encrusted into it, you ponder why it’s here still as you would assume the previous group would have taken most of the valuables. As you stare at the ring you feel drawn to it… almost as if it’s calling out to you.

        You manage to pry your eyes away from the alluring object long enough to look around the rest of the room.

        Looking further around the room, you notice the leftover equipment from what you can only guess is the adventurers that found this place. You inspect the gear to see if anything is of value or usefulness, but it all appears to be leftover junk, broken or moldy. This includes things like bedrolls, bread and old swords.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the edge of the room you spy two doors, one to your left, the other your right…
