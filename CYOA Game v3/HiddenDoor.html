        You ask the girl what she is up to, thinking perhaps you're not the only one being affected by this place. But she simply looked at you and gave the slyest smile you have ever seen. With one quick motion she pulls out one of her blades and begins sliding it through the brickwork… outlining what appears to be a door!
      </p>

      <p>
        Once done she begins pressing her hands against various bricks around the door until, CLICK. One of them sinks into the wall. Slowly, just like the first door, it groans open, clearly not having been open in a long time.

        “Can't hide anything from me!” The enthusiastic girl chirps as she turns back to you, waiting to hear your decision.
