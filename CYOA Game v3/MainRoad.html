        Deciding to take the safer route, you lead your group along the main path. You know it’s a day longer, but you actually wish to get there… and not be eaten by wolves along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the second day of traveling, you run into a group of other adventurers looking for a missing convoy of supplies. The odd group, similar to your’s, consists of members from several races ranging from Human and Elf Wizards, a Dwarven Rogue and a Lizardman Paladin.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the day has come to an end, you opt to share their campfire, believing that it’s safer in numbers. Conversing with the group, they share tales of their previous adventures and even a goblin ambush they recently fought off by using an illusion spell to scare most of the goblins off. Eventually they go on to warn you about the patrols of goblins and how they are waiting to attack a small goblin hideout near the mountains. You contemplate offering to help them with this task, but decide against it, thinking that there would be nothing of value to risk your life over some goblins. As the night draws onwards, your two groups part ways, with yours settling in for the night.
