        As you attempt to push the door, you feel that the stone is warmâ€¦ once again separating itself from its surroundings. Try as you might however, it refuses to budge. You decide to try deciphering the runes, but they appear to be a language you have never seen before. Perhaps it belonged to an ancient civilisation?
