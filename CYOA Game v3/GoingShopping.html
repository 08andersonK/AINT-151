        After sending messengers to retrieve your chosen companions, you look to get ready for the upcoming expedition. Collecting your satchel, you start by packing your journal and maps, followed by some spare clothes. After you finished you put your brand new robe on. Made of a soft, but strong material and dyed to be dark in colour. While you would expect it to be light due to the material, but it actually has a substantial weight that constantly reminds you about the weight of responsibility that wearing this symbolises.

        Eventually the messengers return with your chosen companions. You pick up your trusty blade, forged by one of the greatest bladesmiths in the realm, and make your way outside. Before heading off, you decide to stop at a little shop you know that should have some things for sale that would be of use on your adventure.
