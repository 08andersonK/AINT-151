        Slowly you reach for the floating orb ahead of you. You note that it burns with the same intensity that you saw inside the gem. As you approach, the feeling of heat grows, becoming almost unbearable as it feels like your insides are being incinerated…
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, you make contact with the orb using the same hand you placed the ring on. While you expect the flame to hurt as much as much as any fire… you find it simply feels warm… inviting.

      <p>
        The voice from earlier speaks with joy; “Finally!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The flames engulf you, still not hurting, and before you know it they begin seeping inside you…
      </p>

      <p>
        Darkness surrounds you once more...
