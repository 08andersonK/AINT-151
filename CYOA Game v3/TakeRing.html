        Quickly snatching the ring, you give in to your desire and decide to take the ring. Not wanting to lose it, you decide to place is on your finger, after all it’s not like the ring could be cursed… oh…
      </p>

      <p>
        Before you come back to your senses, you have already placed the ring on your right ring finger. Suddenly a burning sensation ebbs from your finger, this pain becomes so unbearable that you drop to your knees screaming. Your companions try to sooth the pain in various ways but to no avail. Eventually you pass out.

      <p>
        Surrounded by darkness you look around, only to be met with more everlasting darkness. You feel weightless, almost like you are falling… or are you just floating, hard to say given that there is no point of reference. You move your hand around, trying to see if you can feel any of your surroundings, after all, the ring might have blinded you. Speaking of which, you see it’s still on your finger… wait… but how could you see your hand if you were blind…
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, out the corner of your eye, you spot a floating light…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come… accept this gift... “
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking directly towards the light, you feel the warmth radiating onto you… you feel power flowing into you…
