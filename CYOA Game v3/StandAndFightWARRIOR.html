        Although outnumbered, you decide to stand and fight, it’s just goblins and a couple of wolves after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Albert simply holds his ground against the goblins and wolves, trying to intimidate them and make them keep their focus on him and away from you two.

      <p>
        Seeing your fellow adventurers fight bravely, you decide to join them and approach one of the wolfs, sword drawn. Feral and agitated, the wolf jumps at you, teeth glowing in whatever light there is. Remembering your training you step to the side and in one fell swoop, dig your sword into the wolfs head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raising your hands in triumph, you turn to see if anyone saw you… Only to be met with a goblin staring at you, bow drawn and ready to fire. You you hear a loud thump...
      </p>

      <p>
        You turn to face the source of the sound, only to be met with Albert between you and the goblin. He had blocked the arrow with his shield, most likely saving your life!
      </p>

      <p>
        "Best watch your back, can’t always promise I will be able to” your saviour states in a harsh tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a meek nod with your head, you quickly reach for your sword and rejoin the fight, with the warrior watching your back, and you just trying to survive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, after several more close shaves with another wolf and the business end of a goblin spear, you find yourself in the middle of what can only be described as a slaughtering ground, with the corpses of goblins and wolves littering the small clearing you now reside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well… that was fun...” the old timer states with glee. You simply shake your head and tell them to get moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few more hours, you reach your destination at sundown, but after that fight in the woods, you decide it’s best to rest up and delve into the dungeon tomorrow...
