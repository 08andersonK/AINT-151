        Well young master, you cant go alone on this dangerous quest, so we have taken the liberty of rounding up several capable adventurers who would be willing to accompany you on this quest. But due to financial interests, we can only afford to send two...
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are some infomation about them, to help you make a wise decision;
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Irthra Helloak
        <br>
        <b>Race:</b> Human
        <br>
        <b>Description:</b> A lively and upbeat woman who always seems to be on some form of adventure. She has recently requested to join  this expedition in order to “Have some fun” and “Find some treasure”. While her brashness and energetic personality might prove troublesome to deal with, her skills are undeniable. She is known for her resourcefulness and her abilities to pick locks and other… illegal skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Albert Oathblood
        <br>
        <b>Race:</b> Human
        <br>
        <b>Description:</b> While he might appear old and washed up, he has made a small name for himself in the guilds of Westlight by protecting their convoys. With messy greying hair and a full, scruffy beard, he is not the most civilised of men and his lack of a left eye gives off a menacing, appearance. Like I reported earlier, he is a little older than most adventurers, but his swordplay is just as good as any other and he prides himself in his skills with a shield.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Nakira the White
        <br>
        <b>Race:</b> Lizardkin
        <br>
        <b>Description:</b> A member of the life church, Nakira is a white Lizardkin who is a capable healer. However, don't let that fool you into thinking she cant handle herself in a fight, as due to her racial attributes and the strength given to her by her deity, she can be as effective as any warrior. Her biggest asset would be her healing ability, which far outperform any healing potion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Name:</b> Lithion Spellfaere
        <br>
        <b>Race:</b> Elf
        <br>
        <b>Description:</b> Lithion comes from our own mage circle here in Westlight. He was a very talented student and is looking to begin traveling to expand his knowledge, which is very fitting for your job. Like you, he is a man of eloquence and high society due to both his profession and bloodline. He has trained in several elemental magics including Fire, Water and Earth, but has also begun training in many other forms in order to expand his horizons, one of which is light magic, which could prove most useful in the dark dungeon you will soon findyourself in.
