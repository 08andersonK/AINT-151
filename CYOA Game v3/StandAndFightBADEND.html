      <p>
        Although outnumbered, you decide to stand and fight, it’s just goblins and a couple of wolves after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ithra slowly approaches one of the goblins, holding both her daggers closely in front of her. Then, before the goblin could even blink, his head was separated from his body in a single, clean strike of her blades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Holding out his hand, Lithion quietly chants some words of power. A flash then erupts from his hand and sends a shot of flames towards the goblin. Bursting into flames, for the few seconds its able to, you are met with the terrified gargling of the goblin before it's become nothing but ashes...
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing your fellow adventurers fight bravely, you decide to join them and approach one of the wolfs, sword drawn. Feral and agitated, the wolf jumps at you, teeth glowing in whatever light there is. Remembering your training you step to the side and in one fell swoop, dig your sword into the wolfs head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Raising your hands in triumph, you turn to see if anyone saw you… Only to be met with a goblin staring at you, bow drawn and ready to fire. You go to move, reaching for your sword in panic when suddenly you hear a loud thump...
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking down you see a long, crude arrow sticking out of your chest. Slowly reaching for it you fall to your knees. Everything then suddenly goes cold as another arrow plants itself not too far from the first. This time without any pain, almost as if your body couldn't handle it.
      </p>

      <p>
        You fall on your back, looking up at the canopy. Breathing becomes hard, you feel like your out of breath. Slowly the world starts getting darker, was it really night already? Your body goes numb and slowly your eyes get heavy…
      </p>

      <p>
        BAD END
