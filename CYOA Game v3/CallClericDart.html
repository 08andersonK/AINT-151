        Hearing your pleas for help, the white Lizardkin woman comes rushing to your side and, upon seeing the dart in your leg, begins chanting a purification prayer. After several moments you notice a look of confusion on her face, then several moments later she stops chanting all together… In a panic you ask what's wrong?
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nothing… There is nothing wrong… You haven't been poisoned. Looks like the poison has dried off the dart, likely due to how long they have been here”
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting up you carefully pick up one of the darts that missed you. Checking the tip you notice that, while the end of the needle is stained a light green, but there is nothing actually on it. Looks like she is right… Lucky...
