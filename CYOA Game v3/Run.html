        Before you get too into a fight, you decide this is not worth risking your life and immediately order your companions to run from this encounter.
      </p>

      <p>
        While your companions would prefer to defeat the threat here and now, they choose to follow you, mainly out of obligation rather than agreeing with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        After several panicked moments, you find yourself back at the fork… Looks like you will be going the long way afteral… Chicken.
