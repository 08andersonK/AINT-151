        Deciding to take this hidden route, you lead your group down this rune lit hallway. Looking around as you travel, you marvel at the beauty of the runes marked along the walls, the shapes, the lights and the even the power emanating from each rune.

        Eventually you come to a new room that appears to be a stairway… or what’s left of one.
