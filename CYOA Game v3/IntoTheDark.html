      <p>
        Not fearing something as inconsequential as the dark, you begin to make your way down the stairs… Or at least, you started…
      </p>

      <p>
        You quickly find out that one of these stairs had crumbled away… and you were currently in a roll heading down. Each step you felt another bone breaks.With each bounce you felt your momentum increase. This went on for several moments. You would almost begin to wonder how deep this tunnel was… Y'know, if you were not currently falling to your death!
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually you hit flat ground with one last crunch… you can't feel anything… but if you could, you know it would be VERY painful and embarrassing…
      </p>

      <p>
        BAD END
