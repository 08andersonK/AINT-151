        Before you touch the floating ball of light, you quickly pull away, not wanting to get lured into another trap you defiantly shout at the orb, demanding that it let you go!

      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing happens…

      </p>

      <p>
        Then more nothing…

      </p>

      <p>
        “So be it...” comes the voice of the orb once more, before slowly fading from whatever existence there is…

      </p>

      <p>
        You wait for days… or was it weeks… you can't really tell… there’s nothing to gauge time in this place. Eventually you start feeling weak, but not physically. Almost like your not yourself. It’s like you're not you… or me… We cant tell anymore…

        ...

        BAD END
