        Readying his shield, Albert slowly makes his way down the hallway, taking great care to keep his shield between the holes in the wall and you and your companions, lest a dart hits you. Due to your slow movement it takes quite a while your you to reach the room at the end, but eventually, after several close shaves, you all make it to the other side
